            program at HPI School of Design Thinking where the ides were
            created by a multidisciplinary team of students. Each tem member
            was required to work largely equally on every aspect of the
            development of the final product and learn the process involved in
            solving a problem using design thinking through a practical
            challenge.

                After receiving our challenge we deconstructed it and came to
                a shared understanding of what each component of the challenge
                meant to us . Based on our findings we  wrote down all of the
                different stakeholders and people we thought would
                be interesting to talk into the context of household food-
                waste. Having identified households of different sizes and
                varying cultural background, we then identified topics of
                interest to explore with them during the interviews.
                Approximately a thousand internet articles, Podcasts, YouTube
                videos and social  media posts later, we ended our desktop
                research and triangulate it down to the following facts:

                Once we’ve gotten an understanding that food waste is one of
                the many issues at the  crossroads of climate change and
                social injustices, we had to see it with our own eyes.

                  at a generic grocery store,  took a closer look at the
                  amount of food that people leave on their plates eating  out
                  and spied out a Kashmiri mother preparing the family dinner.

                  <span>Immerse:</span> But in order to really get an overview
                  we had to go out into the world ourselves. Not only have we
                  fought our way through the jungle of already  existing food
                  waste management applications, but also have spared no cost
                  and effort to immerse in a local zero waste shop. Also
                  nothing has stopped us to check out a supermarket dumpster.
                  Last but not least we have rolled up our  sleeves and
                  assisted in an upcoming Kashmiri family feast.

                  <span>Interview:</span> To ultimately round off this
                  process, the team pulled out pen and  paper and talked the
                  various household sizes and cultural backgrounds as 
                  identified in the previous step. Among them a multi-
                  generational family in Kashmir, Margot, who is a stay- at-

                By methodically analyzing individual aspects of the
                experience, we figured out what stood out and what the most
                important learnings from each  of our research activities
                were. But even after this first filtration, we still had to
                narrow down the information in order to get to the root of the
                problem that we were trying to solve. This process is all
                about avoiding  potentially misleading routes and prioritizing
                information.

                In Design Thinking, stepping into the Ideation Phase is a
                giant leap into an entirely different work- mode. Fortunately,
                we had a  great set of tools that would guide us throughout
                the day. It all started with a skinny- dip into  the How-
                Might- We- Pool where we challenged ourselves to pose problem
                related questions  that would help us further process our POV.
                We then decided on the two most important  HMWs, that we would
                save from the troubled water:
              </p>
              <ol class="hidden font-medium-18">
                <li>
                  How might we provide Linash with better ways to monitor her
                  fresh produce?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How might we transfer knowledge about food management in a
                  fun and interesting way?
                </li>

            <p class="p1 hidden font-regular-16">
              These questions could then be used for an ultrasonic game of hot
              potato: Whenever the digital  hot potato hits your avatar, you
              have to shout out the first idea that comes to your mind  before
              you throw the burning hot idea-machine towards one of your
              teammates. After 8 Minutes of pure stress and with throats sore
              from laughter, we were confronted with a lot of ideas in
              desperate need of filtration.

                3 filtration questions helped us to narrow down out choice:

              Only two ideas had proven to be  strong enough to go through all
              three filters While the "State of Food Indicator 3000" was a
              system focused on detecting fruits and  vegetables about to go
              bad using chemical indicators the "Effortless Food Management
              System 1000" later finalised as ScruberJay was thought to be an
              ecosystem that integrates data about the food you bought and
              how  long it lasts. In short brainstorms we thought both ideas
              through, creating dashboards that would indicate the essence of
              our ideas, potential users, and its relevance in the real world.

          As such the now called "ScruberJay" aims to minimize food waste
          by gathering data on its users' groceries at the supermarket to then
          organize  them better from the shelf to the meal. With just one
          click you get an  overview of everything you have bought and
          ScruberJay then advises users  how to store their food and sends
          reminders when food is about to expire. To complete the whole
          framework, ScruberJay also helps you to conjure up small, quick
          dishes with exactly the food you have not yet used up.

          The prototype we developed was then tried out by our stakeholders
          (aka friends and family to be honest) and put through its paces. In
          this way, the previously made assumptions and solution  approaches
          were checked for their correctness. Through this process, we learned
          very important  aspects of the problem to be solved, and through
          reflection, we were able to improve our prototype  even further.

              Due to the COVID crisis, and owing to the time constraints of
              the program, we tested our application mockup in an online
              meeting setup, where the testers were asked to interact with
              the  application and walk us through their experience of
              interacting with the application. In addition to it,
              <span class="font-medium-16">to test the 'food expiry alert' function of the application,
                the testers were sent SMS alerts to their personal phone
                numbers</span>
              (we had a peek into their fridges beforehand) in the middle of
              the  interview. This was done to understand if they liked the
              functionality and how often would they be  comfortable with
              getting reminded of their food expiring & other recipe
              recommendations

        <p class="p1 hidden">
          Although the critical function of our prototype suited well with our
          testers, we improvised our  application mockup and added the
          additional features as suggested in the interviews like, being able 
          to add favourite recipies manually, a data security assurance,
          multiple recipe recommendations &  future grocery suggestions

          With only 8 weeks to work on the final solution, the focus was on
          building a Minimum Viable Product and testing key functions with the
          target audience, rather than completing a fully functional app. The
          process reinforced the idea of "failing fast and failing forward,"
          pushing for rapid iteration and returning to the drawing board when
          necessary to rethink a new solution.
