            The app syncs with supermarket chains to automatically track users' purchases, offering storage tips, expiry 
            reminders, and quick meal suggestions using ingredients on hand. By leveraging machine learning, ScruberJay predicts 
            the shelf life of perishable items and helps users make the most of their groceries before they spoil. This seamless 
            ecosystem connects supermarkets and consumers, making food management more efficient and sustainable.`,
